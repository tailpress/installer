## About TailPress

> **Note:** This repository contains the code of the TailPress installer. If you want to build a theme using TailPress, go to the [TailPress repository](https://github.com/tailpress/tailpress).

[TailPress](https://tailpress.io) is your go-to starting point for your next [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) powered [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) theme.

To get started, have a look at the [documentation](https://tailpress.io/docs).

## Install WordPress

It is possible to install WordPress through the installer. You will be prompted with this option.

Note that this will setup WordPress, but you still need a local development environment for PHP and a database. If you use MacOS, try out [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/valet) or [Herd](https://herd.laravel.com).
